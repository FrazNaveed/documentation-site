Flare has four networks, each serving different purposes, so choosing the right one is crucial. All of these networks operate on a permissionless basis and are EVM compatible:

- **Flare Mainnet.** The production network where all the action happens. Transactions cost real money here.

- **Flare Testnet Coston2.** Test your applications without spending real money. This should be your first choice when developing applications.

- **Songbird Canary-Network.** Experimental proving ground for Flare.

- **Songbird Testnet Coston.** The testnet for Songbird Canary-Network.

The most common development tracks are:

- **Flare Testnet Coston2 → Flare Mainnet**: Recommended track for application developers.

- **Songbird Testnet Coston → Songbird Canary-Network → Flare Testnet Coston2 → Flare Mainnet**: Required track for all protocol level changes.

## Configuration

Configuration for all Flare networks, along with public and private RPCs, blockchain explorers, and faucets.

## Community tools

Developer tools for Flare built by the community including RPCs, bridges, indexers, account abstraction, wallet SDKs, and more.

## Supported wallets

Several desktop, browser and mobile app based wallets support Flare. Discover suitable options for your needs on the [Flare Wallets](https://flare.network/wallets/) page.

## Transaction format

- **Address space:** Matches Ethereum, 20-byte addresses using ECDSA.

- **Transaction format:** Matches Ethereum, complies with [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718), encoded with [RLP](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp/).

- **Transaction fees:**

  - **Type0** (Legacy) - Fee is calculated as `gasUsed * gasPrice`.

  - **Type2** (EIP-1559) - Fee is calculated as `(baseFee + priorityFee) * gas`. Both the base and priority fees are burned.

## Smart contracts

- **RPC-API:** [Ethereum RPC API](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/)

- **Supported opcodes:** All [opcodes](https://www.evm.codes/?fork=london) up to the London hard fork are supported.

## Block verification

- **Header:** [Verifying block header in Go](https://github.com/flare-foundation/go-flare/blob/main/coreth/consensus/dummy/consensus.go#L187).

- **Body:** [Validating block body in Go](https://github.com/flare-foundation/go-flare/blob/main/coreth/core/block_validator.go#L62).

- **Verify transaction in block:** Merkle Patricia Trie verification against the receipt root.

## Consensus

- **Sybil resistance mechanism:** Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

- **Delegation:** In-protocol

- **Block time:** ≈1.8 seconds

- **Finality:** Single-slot. Once a block is validated through the gossip protocol, it is finalized.

- **Transaction ordering:** Leaders' discretion, default behaviour is priority gas auction.

- **Consensus mechanism:** Snowman++ (from [Avalanche](https://docs.avax.network)) offers a high-throughput, totally ordered consensus mechanism alongside a leader protocol to minimize MEV.

- **Consensus participants:** Validators vote on block proposals and serve as leaders. To serve as a validator, a node must meet a governance defined [minimum self-bond](https://proposals.flare.network/FIP/FIP_5.html). Validators are randomly selected as leaders to propose new blocks. The probability of being elected leader is proportional to the validator's stake.

- **Enshrined protocols:** In addition to consensus, Flare validators are also data providers for [FTSO](/ftso/overview) and attestation providers for [FDC](/fdc/overview).

- **Stake distribution:** Network comprises [over 90 validators](https://flarescan.com/validators) with a median stake of ≈0.7% and a maximum stake of ≈3.3%. This includes both self-bonded and delegated stakes.

:::note[Adding Flare's native token FLR to your exchange]

Flare is just like Ethereum. To add it to your exchange:

- Set up an [RPC node](/run-node/rpc-node)
- Use the appropriate [network configuration](#configuration) for Flare Mainnet
