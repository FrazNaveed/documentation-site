The FAssets system by Flare enables non-smart contract tokens like Bitcoin and XRP to interact trustlessly with smart contracts on the Flare network, unlocking their use in DeFi applications. It achieves this through collateralized minting, utilizing Flare's State Connector and Time Series Oracle for secure cross-chain functionality.

Agents in the FAssets system facilitate the minting and redemption of FAssets by providing over-collateralized assets and managing transactions securely. A liquidator in the FAssets system monitors agent's collateralization levels to ensure the system's security and trustlessness.

In this guide, you will learn the preferred methods for setting up and managing the FAssets agents using the frontend interface and running the liquidator bot.
